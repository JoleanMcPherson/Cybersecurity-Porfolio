# Security Awareness Training Program Proposal

## 📋 Overview

This document proposes a structured and cost-effective Security Awareness Training program for organizations, leveraging existing tools (SharePoint, ServiceNow GRC) and integrating optional industry-standard platforms for training delivery and phishing simulations.

## 🎯 Program Objectives

- **Educate staff** on cybersecurity best practices (phishing, password hygiene, insider threats, etc.)
- **Promote compliance** with internal policies and frameworks (CJIS, NIST, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Satisfy audit requirements** through documented, trackable training programs

## 📅 Quarterly Program Structure

Each training cycle lasts **six weeks** and includes the following elements:

| Week | Training Type | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Kickoff Email + Intro Video | Email from CISO, brief intro video hosted on SharePoint |
| 2–3 | Core Training Module | Key topics: phishing, passwords, insider threats (hosted via SharePoint or LMS) |
| 4 | Quiz & Certificate | Microsoft Forms or LMS quiz; results tracked in SharePoint |
| 5 | Phishing Simulation | Simulated phishing test using KnowBe4 or GoPhish |
| 6 | Remediation | Follow-up training for those who clicked or failed quiz; tracked via ServiceNow GRC |

## 🛠️ Tool Recommendations

### Leveraging Existing Infrastructure
- **SharePoint**: Host training content and policies
- **Microsoft Forms**: Quizzes and certificates  
- **Loom**: Record internal awareness videos
- **ServiceNow GRC**: Track training completion and manage remediation

### Optional Tools for Program Expansion
- **KnowBe4**: Full-featured training and phishing simulation (`$12–$20/user/year`)
- **Wizer**: Free tier with optional premium upgrades (`$1–$5/user/year`)
- **Articulate 360** or **TalentLMS**: Build or host SCORM-compliant modules

## 💰 Estimated Budget

| Line Item | Lean Setup ($) | Premium Setup ($) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| LMS (SharePoint + Forms) | 0 | 1,500–3,000 |
| Training Content | Free (Wizer) | 12,000–20,000 |
| Phishing Simulation | Free (GoPhish) | Bundled with KnowBe4 |
| Video Tools | 120 | 300–500 |
| **Total (Annual)** | **500–2,000** | **15,000–25,000** |

## 🚀 Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1** (Month 1): Set up SharePoint structure and initial content
2. **Phase 2** (Month 2): Deploy first quarterly training cycle
3. **Phase 3** (Month 3): Analyze results and refine approach
4. **Phase 4** (Ongoing): Quarterly cycle implementation

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Training completion rates** (target: >95%)
- **Quiz scores** (target: >80% pass rate)
- **Phishing simulation click rates** (target: <10%)
- **Incident reduction** year-over-year
- **Compliance audit scores**
