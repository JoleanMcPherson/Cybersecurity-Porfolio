üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot Deployment & Analysis
Overview:
As part of the KANO Cyber Institute curriculum, I developed and deployed a custom honeypot to monitor and analyze unauthorized access attempts over a five-day period.

Key Activities:

Custom Honeypot Development:
Engineered a Python-based honeypot configured to listen on ports 5900 (VNC), 25565 (Minecraft), and 8888 (Jupyter Notebook), simulating vulnerable services to attract potential attackers.

Deployment Environment:
Utilized a Linux server hosted on the KANO Cloud platform to run the honeypot continuously for five days, ensuring consistent data collection.

Data Collection & Analysis:
Captured network traffic and logged connection attempts, which were then ingested into Splunk for analysis. Developed a Splunk dashboard to visualize and interpret the data effectively.

Findings:

During the initial four days, the honeypot recorded minimal activity. However, on the fifth day, there was a significant spike in traffic, with approximately 82,000 connection attempts, predominantly originating from IP addresses associated with DigitalOcean. This surge provided valuable insights into scanning behaviors and potential attack vectors.
